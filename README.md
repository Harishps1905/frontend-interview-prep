# frontend-interview-prep

This repository is a curated collection of frontend interview preparation notes and question sets focused on senior-level frontend engineering topics (2025). It collects compact, practical guidance across algorithms/DSA, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React design patterns, Redux Toolkit, and HTML/CSS — ideal for quick review before interviews.

## Contents

Below is a short description of each file in this repo to help you find topics quickly.

- `fe-dsa-questions.md` — Frontend-focused data-structures & algorithms problems and solutions. Covers common interview problems for arrays, strings, recursion, sliding-window, two-pointers, and caching (LRU). Includes reasoning and example implementations.

- `javascript-questions.md` — Core and advanced JavaScript interview questions: scoping, closures, event loop, promises/async-await, modules, patterns for error handling, and common gotchas.

- `typeScript-questions.md` — TypeScript topics for interviews: utility types, mapped and conditional types, typing patterns for APIs and React components, and useful `tsconfig` tips.

- `react-questions.md` — High-value React interview questions and explanations: hooks deep dives (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useTransition`, etc.), concurrent rendering, SSR/SSG, reconciliation, and performance optimization techniques.

- `react-design-patterns.md` — Practical React design patterns and recipes: custom hooks, compound components, render props, context/service layers, forwardRef examples, and patterns for testable, maintainable component architectures.

- `redux-toolkit-questions.md` — Redux Toolkit and RTK Query focused notes: store setup with `configureStore`, slices, thunks, RTK Query basics, optimistic updates, and recommended patterns for side-effects.

- `html-css-questions.md` — HTML and CSS interview materials: accessibility best practices, responsive images and layouts, container queries, modern layout techniques (`grid`/`flexbox`), and performance-related patterns.
